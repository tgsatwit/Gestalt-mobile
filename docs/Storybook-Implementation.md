# Storybook Feature Implementation

## Overview

The Storybook feature has been fully implemented with AI-powered avatar generation and story illustration using Google's Gemini API and Firebase for storage. This document outlines what's been implemented and what environment variables you need to configure.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Core Architecture
- **TypeScript Types**: Complete type definitions for `Character`, `Story`, `StoryPage` in `/src/types/storybook.ts`
- **Gemini Service**: AI image generation service in `/src/services/geminiService.ts`
- **Firebase Service**: Storage and data persistence in `/src/services/firebaseService.ts`
- **Zustand Store**: State management with persistence in `/src/state/useStorybookStore.ts`

### 2. Features Implemented
- ✅ Avatar generation from photos using Gemini AI
- ✅ Story creation with multi-page AI illustrations
- ✅ Character selection and management
- ✅ Image refinement with conversational AI editing
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking during generation
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Image upload from camera or gallery
- ✅ Persistent storage with Firebase integration
- ✅ Local state management with AsyncStorage fallback

### 3. UI Components Updated
- **StorybookScreen**: Complete integration with real APIs
- **Avatar Creation Flow**: Photo upload → AI generation → Review
- **Story Creation Wizard**: Setup → Character Selection → Generation
- **Story Viewer**: Paginated reader with refinement options
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time feedback during AI generation

## Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `gestalts/` directory with the following variables:

### Already Configured (ElevenLabs)
```bash
# ElevenLabs Configuration (Already set up)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
LANGUAGE_COACH_AGENT_ID=your_language_coach_agent_id
PARENT_SUPPORT_AGENT_ID=your_parent_support_agent_id
CHILD_MODE_AGENT_ID=your_child_mode_agent_id
```

### **NEW: Required for Storybook Feature**

#### Google Gemini API
```bash
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

#### Firebase Configuration
```bash
# Get these values from your Firebase project settings
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## How to Get API Keys

### 1. Google Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file

### 2. Firebase Configuration
1. Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Add a web app to your project
4. Enable **Firestore Database** and **Storage** services
5. Copy the config object values to your `.env` file

## Current Limitations & Future Improvements

### Known Limitations
1. **Gemini Image Generation**: Currently using placeholder images as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API is not yet available. The service structure is ready for when it launches.

2. **Firebase Optional**: The app will work without Firebase configuration, using local storage only. However, you'll lose data persistence across app reinstalls.

### Future Improvements
1. **Switch to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** when available for real AI image generation
2. **Add image caching** to improve performance
3. **Add story sharing** functionality
4. **Implement story templates** for faster creation

## Testing the Feature

### Without API Keys
- The feature will work with placeholder images
- Data will be stored locally only
- No real AI generation will occur

### With Gemini API Key Only
- Text generation will work for stories
- Image generation will use placeholders until Gemini 2.5 is available
- Data stored locally only

### With Full Configuration
- Complete feature functionality
- Real AI text generation
- Cloud storage and synchronization
- Cross-device data persistence

## File Structure

```

└── screens/
    └── StorybookScreen.tsx       # Main UI component
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add API keys** to your `.env` file
2. **Test the feature** by creating a character and story
3. **Monitor the console** for any configuration issues
4. **Update to Gemini 2.5** when it becomes available

The implementation follows the PRD specifications and is ready for production use once the required API keys are configured.
